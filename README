v2 Box.net Script.

Will compare the contents of directory on server, 
and the contents on the box.net mounted directory.

Will cp any files that are not found in the box.net directory
to it.

Stuff to be aware of, this script assumes there is no whitespace in file names
may add IFS if needed.  
Shell see later if i want to make it more robust.
