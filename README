v2 Box.net Script.

Basically bash script just checks box.net is mounted and if not mounts.
Dumps the mysql db
then calls python script which copies the files to the box.net directory.

NEED:

- davfs2 to mount box.net if chosing to use that as your backup location.
I setup my box.net following these steps:
